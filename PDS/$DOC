This data set contains several utilities for processing and
analyzing SMF data.

Among the programs in this collection -

COPYMAN - A utility to copy the contents of a VSAM ESDS
formatted as a MAN data set to a sequential data set.  COPYMAN
provides a control data set that can specify a date and time
range to copy.  Unlike IFASMFDP, the starting date and time and
the ending date and time specify a true range; FROM(yyyy/mm/dd
hh:mm:ss) TO(yyyy.mm.dd hh:mm:ss) will copy all the records in
the specified range, where IFASMFDP, while it has similar
parameters, does not work like that.  Also, unlike IFASMFDP, the
input data set must be a MAN type data set.  COPYMAN has no
option to format a MAN type data set after a successful copy.

DSREF - A utility to report users using data sets.

SCAN118 - A utility to show IP addresses used by TSO users.  It
is particularly useful when the MVS IP stack is is directly
connected to the internet, without using a VPN of some sort.  TSO
users using a VPN cause unexpected IP addresses.

SMFCOPY - A utility to copy sequential data sets containing SMF
data.  As with COPYMAN, its date and time specifies a true range.

SMFSTAT - A TSO command processor that produces a list similar to
the output from the operator D SMF commanmd.  SMFSTAT will run in
TSO in batch.

                             C O P Y M A N

COPYMAN copies SMF data from a VSAM ESDS frmatted to be used as a
SYS1.MAN data set.  It is slightly faster than IFASMFDP.

JCL --

//        EXEC PGM=COPYMAN[,PARM=WRITEHDR]
//SYSPRINT DD  SYSOUT=*
//SMFIN    DD  -- Specify the MAN data set to copy --
//SMFOUT   DD  -- Specify a sequential data set to receive the
                  SMF data --
//SYSIN    DD  -- Specify a control data set or PDS member
                  containing options for COPYMAN --

The EXEC statement PARM parameter specifies an option.  WRITEHDR
directs COPYMAN to write an SMF type 2 record as the first SMF
record in the output data set and an SMF type 3 record as the
last record in the output data set.  COPYMAN does not write these
records if PARM=WRIEHDR is not specified.

The data set specified by the DD statement with DD name SYSPRINT
is a sequential data set containing COPYMAN message output.  It
is assigned DCB attributes RECFM=VBA, LRECL=125.

The data set specified by the DD statement with DD name SMFIN is
an SMF ESDS formated by IFASMFDP to be used as a MAN data set.
If this DD statement is not present, COPYMAN attempts to allocate
and use the currently active MAN data set.  Obviously, the user
running COPYMAN must have READ access to the data set.

The data set specified by the DD statement with DD name SMFOUT is
a sequential data set.  COPYMAN forces RECFM=VBS, LRECL=32767 for
the data set; it does not specify a BLKSIZE to allow the use of
"system determined blksize" or a BLKSIZE specified by the DD
statement.

The data set specified by the DD statement with DD name SYSIN is
a sequential data set or PDS containing control instructions for
COPYMAN.

COPYMAN accepts these control statements -

SELECT  ttt,...,ttt-ttt
EXCLUDE ttt,...,ttt-ttt
FROM yyyy/mm/dd hh:mm:ss
TO   yyyy/mm/dd hh:mm:ss

ttt on the SELECT and EXCLUDE statements represents an SMF record
type from 0 through 255. ttt-ttt specifies a range of SMF record
types.  COPYMAN copies all records if no SELECT or EXCLUDE
statement is present in the control data set.

The FROM and TO control statements specify a date and time range
for records to copy.  If FROM is not specified COPYMAN copies
records starting at 1900/01/01.  If TO is not specified COPYMAN
copies records from the FROM data and time through 2099/12/31.

                               D S R E F

DSREF reports data set usage by userid.  A typical report line
looks like this -

SMYERS.ISPF.ISPPROF                           1319
 *SMYERS    SMFDUMP

The 1319 at the right represents the number of times the data set was
accessed.  SMYERS was flagged with an * to indicate the data set
was opened for output by user SMYERS.

DSREF also reports data set usage by userid.  A sample is -

SMYERS
 CBT001.U.CLIST CBT001.U.PANELS CBT001.U.SKELS ISSI.CLIST ISSI.SISPMENU
 ISSI.SYSEXEC SMYERS.AA.ASM SMYERS.AB.ASM SMYERS.AC.ASM SMYERS.AC.ASMLIS
 SMYERS.AC.CLIST SMYERS.AC.LOAD SMYERS.AC.OBJ SMYERS.AC.PCLIST

This report is sorted by userid; the data set list is sorted by
data set name.

One final, optional report is a list of jobs and TSO sessions
sorted by jobname or TSO userid.

JCL -
//        EXEC PGM=DSREF,PARM='option,...,option'
//SYSPRINT DD  SYSOUT=*
//SMF      DD  -- Specifiy data sets containing SMF data --

DSREF accerpts these option strings in the EXEC statment PARM=
parameter -

SORTREFCOUNT - Sort the data set list by reference count.
SORTDSN - Sort the list of referenced data sets by data set name.
JOBLIST - List the jobs and TSO sessions in the input data,
          JOBLIST may be useful in determining which jobs for
          a user are referencing a data set.
NOJOBLIST - Do not list the jobs and TSO sessions.
WIDELINE - Print reports containing lists of userids over the
           entire 120 byte output line in the SYSPRINT data set
NOWIDELINE - Print reports containing lists of userids over an
             80 byte output line.  This option is useful for
             users displaying output on 3270 type displays.

The default is equivalent to SORTREFCOUNT,NOWIDELINE,NOJOBLIST.

DD statements -

SYSPRINT - The DD statement with DD name SYSPRINT specifies the
           DSREF report data set.  It has DCB parameters RECFM=VBA,
           LRECL=125.  BLKSIZE is not specified so the system can
           use "system determined blksize."
SMF - The DD statement with DD name SMF dpecifies one or more
      data sets containing SMF data.  GDG all data set allocation
      can be used to process all data sets in a concatenation of
      SMF data sets.

                             S M F C O P Y

SMFCOPY copies SMF data from a sequential data set containing SMF
records to another data set.

JCL --

//        EXEC PGM=SMFCOPY
//SYSPRINT DD  SYSOUT=*
//SMFIN    DD  -- Data set containg SMF data --
//SMFOUT   DD  -- Output data set containing SMF data --
//SYSIN    DD  -- Sequential data set or PDS member containing
                  control data for SMFCOPY --

The data set specified by the DD statement with DD name SYSIN
specifies data used to control the operation of SMFCOPY.
SMFCOPY accepts these control statements --

yyyy/mm/dd hh:mm:ss yyyy/mm/dd hh:mm:ss

Unlike the other statements accepted by SMFCOPY, this statement
is fixed format.  The first date/time pair specifies a start date
and time.  Records before this date and time are not copied.  The
second date/time pair specifies and ending date and time; SMF
records after this date and time are not copied by SMFCOPY.

SELECT  ttt,...,ttt-ttt
EXCLUDE ttt,...,ttt-ttt

ttt represets an SMF record type, from 0 through 255.  ttt-ttt
represents a range of SMF records.

SYS xxxx

xxxx represents an SMF system ID, 1 to 4 characters.  Additional
  charcters are ignored.

SCAN118 displays the IP addresses used by TSO users.

A typical session might look like this -

SMYERS  09/13 10:00:02->09/14 11:43:37    25:43 TCP06012 108.24.138.140

  |           |               |             |      |           |
  |           |               |             |      |     IP V4 address
  |           |               |             |   VTAM LU

  |           |               |           Session
  |           |               |           time, as
  |           |               |           hh:mm
  |           |         Date & time
  |           |         session terminated
  |     Date & time
  |     session started
Userid

It also prints a detailed report of TCPIP sessions.

09/12  0:01:00->09/13  3:30:59 TCP06012    27:29 108.24.138.140
       ^               ^          ^          ^         ^
       |               |          |          |         |
       |               |          |          |   IP V4 address
       |               |          |        Session
       |               |          |        time, as
       |               |          |        hh:mm
       |               |       VTAM LU
       |               |       assigned to
       |               |       session
       |        Date & time
       |        session terminated
Date & time
session started

The date and time may represent the start date and time for the
SMF data.

The VTAM LU is important; it is the link between the SMF data for
a TSO user and the IP/VTAM bridge session reported in SMF type
118 records.

One final report shows two or more users using the same IP
address.  In most environments this represents multiple terminals
sharing a LAN; the address is assigned to the router by the ISP.

TWO OR MORE USERS USE THE FOLLOWING IP ADDRESSES -
172.18.1.233    CBT001   Z531415
174.85.16.96    KALINICH TRIDJK   TRIDJKA

JCL --
//        EXEC PGM=SCAN118,PARM='option,option'
//SYSPRINT DD  -- Sequential report data set --
//SMF      DD  -- Sequential data set containing SMF data --

SCAN118 accepts these options -
 - SORTTIME - Display the TSO session report sort by logon time.
 - SORTUSER - Display the TSO session report sorted by userid.
 - SORTIP -   Display the TSO session report sorted by IP address.
 - DUMPRECS - Dump SMF type 118 records.
 - NODUMPRECS - Do not dump SMF type 118 records.
 - SESSION - Report the IP sessions.
 - NOSESSION - Do not report the IP sessions.

The defaults are equivalent to SORTTIME,SESSION.

SMFSTAT, unlike the other programs in this collection, is a TSO
command processor to display data similar to the operator D SMF
command.  SMFSTAT will run in TSO in batch and send its output to
the SYSTSPRT data set.

CAPACITY    USED    %   STATUS  DATA SET
  72,000     873   1.21 ACTIVE  SYS1.CBT.MAN1
  72,000      15   0.02 DUMPREQ SYS1.CBT.MAN2
  72,000       9   0.01 DUMPREQ SYS1.CBT.MAN3

The corresponding output from D SMF is -

  NAME                VOLSER SIZE(BLKS) %FULL  STATUS
P-SYS1.CBT.MAN1       CBTCAT     72000     1  ACTIVE
S-SYS1.CBT.MAN2       CBTCAT     72000     1  DUMP REQUIRED
S-SYS1.CBT.MAN3       CBTCAT     72000     1  DUMP REQUIRED

The expanded percentage allows the terminal operator to correctly
judge data set usage when the percentage is 99% + but not quite
100%.

COPYMAN and SMFCOPY were developed in a low use system with large
SMF MAN data sets that typically accumulated several days and
some times weeks of SMF data before they were dumped, so the
dumped data sets were correspondingly quite large.  This is the
reason the FROM and TO parameters specify a true range.
